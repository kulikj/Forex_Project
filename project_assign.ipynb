At this point of the semester, we haven't studied the machine learning methods yet, but you should have a general idea of what you can do with ML. If you do not, ask a TA or the professor or do a little googling."

    "- Code and output which is clearly documented and implemented efficiently so as not to distract from the flow of the report.\n",

Critique your results; should they be accepted at face value or were some assumptions made inappropriate? What actions should be taken (if any) as a result of the analysis, and how confident are you in these actions?
